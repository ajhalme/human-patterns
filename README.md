## Human Patterns

Antti Halme, 2019

#### Summary

Human Patterns is a play concept that brings together Twister-like full body physical controls, a "Big Brother" themed hardware configuration, and a computer vision based pattern matching system.

This repository contains the first version of the software system that facilitates the play, and brings all the parts together.

HumanPatternV1 is a C++ application that leverages the UI library Qt, and the computer vision libray OpenCV.

To run the game, you need a video source (designed for RTSP, any webcam should get you going) as well as AruCo markers (from the default marker set). Four markers define the play area.
