Antti Halme, 2019

#### Summary

Human Patterns is a play concept that brings together a Twister-like full body physical control, a "Big Brother" themed hardware configuration, and a computer vision based pattern matching system.

This repository contains the first version of the software system that facilitates the play, and brings all the parts together.

HumanPatternV1 is a C++ application that leverages the UI library Qt, and the computer vision libray OpenCV.
